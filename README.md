# docker-speedtest-v2

New version of the docker speedtest tool. The components are more decoupled and the UI is reworked to allow manual tests and more data.

## Getting Started

First create an environment file (`db.env`) that contains the line `POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<YOUR PASSWORD HERE>`.

You can then run the docker compose script:

```bash
docker-compose up
```
